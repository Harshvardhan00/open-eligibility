  header: This API is completely open, and does not require authentication. Please do not use it for any production purposes. If you would like to have a stable version stood up for regular usage, submit an issue and I am happy to set one up for you.
  footer: I keep this up and running as a functional API so I can develop on it, and keep evolving it as I replicated, and deploy for other projects. If there is something you would like to see added to this API, let me know.
